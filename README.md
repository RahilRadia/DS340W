This project is an extension of the research done by Fareed et al. and their ADD-Net model. Our research aims
to focus more on recall and address the issues of false negative classifications in a clinical setting. Additionally,
we aim to mitigate the poor performance on unbalanced datasets that ADD-Net faced.
